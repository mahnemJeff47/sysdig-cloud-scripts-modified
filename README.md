# sysdig-cloud-scripts
This repository holds various scripts and templates that may be helpful for (among other things):

- Deploying the Sysdig Cloud agent in various platforms: [/agent_deploy/](https://github.com/draios/sysdig-cloud-scripts/tree/master/agent_deploy)
- Deploying Sysdig Enterprise on-premise: [/onprem_deploy/](https://github.com/draios/sysdig-cloud-scripts/tree/master/onprem_deploy)
- Integrating Sysdig Cloud with other platforms: [/integrations/](https://github.com/draios/sysdig-cloud-scripts/tree/master/integrations)

Please note that this functionality is different from the core [Sysdig Cloud application checks](http://support.sysdigcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/205147903), which automatically collect metrics from a wide variety of applications and infrastructure components - these app checks should work out of the box with minimal configuration.

# Sysdig Cloud APIs
You may also be interested in the [Sysdig Cloud python client](https://github.com/draios/python-sdc-client): a wrapper for the [Sysdig Cloud REST API](https://sysdig.gitbooks.io/sysdig-cloud-api/content/), which supports a bunch of cool functionality.
